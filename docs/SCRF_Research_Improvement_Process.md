# SCRF: Process - Research Improvement Process

## Introduction

SCRF's culture is based on the open-source software community. Anyone can suggest an improvement or a new process, but it has to fit in the existing framework. Project Proposals are the first step of our Research Improvement Proposal (RIP) process. This is how we decide whether a suggested improvement provides a benefit, whether that benefit is worth the resources spent, and whether or not it makes sense given other projects already in process.

Before you start a new project plan, check the [Research Team](https://github.com/orgs/smartcontractresearchforum/projects/4) board to determine whether something similar doesn't already exist. If you find something close, contact the author or add a comment to the ticket to see if there's a way to merge your ideas into one project.

When you're ready, create a new [ticket](https://github.com/orgs/smartcontractresearchforum/projects/4), and create a new Project Plan from the template below and paste a link to it into the ticket.

Reach out to one of the SCRF team members on the chat and try to arrange some time to discuss the idea during our weekly calls.

Here's a link to the [Project Plan Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gIE3CJFBDxV7bduZBha6E1Kvqc8H_aV5tgaxblO60X4/edit#).

## Method

Create a copy of the [Project Plan Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gIE3CJFBDxV7bduZBha6E1Kvqc8H_aV5tgaxblO60X4/edit#), fill out the relevant fields and then move it to the [Project Proposals](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1nk2Emr6pyGLHx0Hzy-_CfKZJnye2S1bS) directory. Create an issue in GitHub describing the proposal and link to your google doc.

1. Fill out the form
1. Talk about with Ops
1. Update the plan based on feedback
1. Be prepared to create Proof of Concept (POC) if the project is creating a specific deliverable. If the proposal outlines a new type of work then a workflow document will be required.
1. Include plans to present the Proposal to the greater team

## Workflow for a New Proposal

1. Pitch to the Team
    1. Create an 'elevator pitch' - a quick distillation of your idea.
    1. Give a member of the Ops team your elevator pitch
        1. They'll determine whether the project aligns with SCRF goals and scope
    1. Check in the [Research Team](https://github.com/orgs/smartcontractresearchforum/projects/4) pipeline to determine whether or not a pre-existing project already encompasses your suggestion
        1. If an existing project could encompass the suggestion, reach out to the creator in chat, to see if you could incorporate your ideas into theirs.
        1. If an existing project does not encompass the suggestion, create a new issue with a link to your project plan (adapted from the [Project Plan Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gIE3CJFBDxV7bduZBha6E1Kvqc8H_aV5tgaxblO60X4/edit#)) and a brief description of the project in the issue.
1. Create a Proposal
    1. Fill in a Project Plan Template
        1. Consider resources needed, potential scope, etc.
    1. Document should describe how many people, what resources, and how much time in detail. Consider the scope of the project when deciding how much detail to add.
    1. Develop goals and analytics.
        1. How does this project define success?
        1. How is that success tracked?
    1. Develop a timeline.
        1. Broken down by weeks
            1. Week 1:
            1. Week 2:
            1. Etc.
    1. Outline how the project would be tracked in Github
    1. (If External, then create a budget)
    1. Flag Ops for a conversation about the project.
1. Create a proof of concept/workflow document
    1. Discuss with Ops team
    1. Incorporate feedback
1. Create Project Presentation for the group.
    1. Create a 10-minute presentation
        1. This should detail the project and outline the steps and resources needed to implement it.
    1. Schedule a time during SCRF's weekly Wednesday meetings to present your project.
    1. Present the project.
        1. Tally suggestions and concerns raised by the group.
    1. Schedule a follow-up meeting with SCRF Ops team
